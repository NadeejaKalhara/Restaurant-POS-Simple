HOW TO CREATE ZIP FILE FOR DISTRIBUTION
========================================

1. Make sure you've run: npm install
   (This creates the node_modules folder)

2. Zip the entire thermal-printer-script folder including:
   - print.js
   - package.json
   - README.md
   - INSTALL.txt
   - receipt.json (example)
   - node_modules/ (after npm install)
   - install.bat
   - print-test.bat

3. For users receiving the zip:
   - Extract the folder
   - Open Command Prompt in the folder
   - Run: npm install (if node_modules not included)
   - Run: node print.js test "Printer Name"

NOTE: node_modules folder is large (~50MB)
You can exclude it and users will run npm install themselves.

RECOMMENDED ZIP CONTENTS:
--------------------------
✓ print.js
✓ package.json
✓ README.md
✓ INSTALL.txt
✓ receipt.json
✓ install.bat
✓ print-test.bat
✗ node_modules (exclude - let users install)

This keeps the zip file small (~50KB instead of ~50MB)
